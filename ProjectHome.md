PyLab\_Works is a free and open source replacement for LabView + MatLab, written in pure Python. PyLab\_Works is a visual design package, much easier to learn and to extend than LabView. PyLab\_Works also supports a MatLab-like environment for doing scientific and engineering calculations but with a much better general programming environment (thanks to Python + Scipy) than MatLab. Even kids can use it!

**New in v0.4**
  * ADC-Brick supports USB-6008, USB-6009, SoundCard
  * Circuit Plots, draws all kind of responses of an (electrical network)
  * FIR Filter design Brick
  * PyCircuit integration
  * Auto Brick generation, tested on Numpy, Scipy and PIL

The current status is alfa, although we use large parts of it as a regular tool in our daily work (replacing MatLab and LabView). I hope to release the first version with examples and debug tools in december 2008.
